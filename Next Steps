This file details a rough roadmap for fixing the water automation system in the greenhouse. 

Phase 0:
    Gathering Materials:
        - Strip all the cubes, wires and save the servos from the preexisting cubes
        - Make sure raspberry pi is working (Kinan has the SIM card as of 9/23, make sure Kinan gave back the sim card)

Phase 1: 
    Getting Servos Working: 
        - Understand the code, skim cubes.py to get a rough idea of how servos are controlled
        - Test cubes.py on a single servo, tweak it to your liking
        - Control opening/closing a single servo from the main program using the interface (tweak the scheduler function)
        - Connect all servos via a bus to the RPI, get all of them to open/close in a sequence to test

Phase 2:
    Getting Cubes Working:
        - Design and print new cubes that take wiring and placement in greenhouse into account
        - Test open/close on a single cube
        - Test whole system

Phase 3: 
    Getting Pump Working: 
        - Make a circuit to drive the pump using input from the Raspberry Pi, test with oscilloscopes
        - Take raspberry pi, driver circuit to greenhouse, test with pump

Phase 4:
    Wiring, Integration:
        - Figure out how to do wiring 
        - Connect everything
